> A simple and effective tasks app, built with React, that helps you easily organize your daily tasks. The app offers a clean user interface and lets you add tasks, mark them as done, delete them, and view completed, uncompleted, or all tasks.

## Main features
- Add new tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list.

- Mark tasks: Mark tasks as completed or incomplete.

- Delete tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.

- Filter tasks: View all tasks, only completed tasks, or only incomplete tasks.

- Save data locally: All tasks are saved to the browser's local storage, so they remain present even after you refresh the page or close the browser.

- Responsive design: A responsive user interface (UI) that works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies used

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- useReducer Hook: To efficiently manage complex application state.

- Context API: To pass data between components without manually passing props through each layer.

- useEffect Hook: To save and retrieve tasks from local storage.

- HTML5: To structure content.

- CSS3: To style and design the user interface.

- Bootstrap 5: To speed up design and make the interface responsive.

## How to operate locally

1. Make sure you have the following installed on your device:
    - node.js



## Learning from this project
- While building this project, I applied and strengthened my understanding of the following concepts in React:

- Complex state management with useReducer: Understanding how useReducer can be a powerful alternative to useState in more complex state management scenarios.

- Using the Context API: How to pass data at the application level to avoid the problem of "prop drilling."

- Local Storage: Saving and retrieving user data to ensure task persistence across different browser sessions.

- Responsive design with Bootstrap: Integrating the Bootstrap library to create a responsive and beautiful user interface.

- DOM control (limited): Although React encourages avoiding direct manipulation of the DOM, some techniques were used to control the display of completed and incomplete task elements for filtering purposes, while adhering to React principles as closely as possible.
